## Working AmigoðŸ’»
The Working Amigo is a Pomodoro Technique-inspired tool that utilizes subtle lighting cues to enhance focus and productivity, while also serving as a non-verbal communication device to indicate work and rest periods to users and their surroundings.

## Background
#### The Great Illusion: Busyness as Productivity
For knowledge workers in today's hectic work setting, the challenge of deeply focusing on tasks, a concept Dr. Cal Newport discusses in his book "Deep Work," is all too common. This difficulty arises because it's often unclear how to measure the value of each person's contributions to their job. As a result, there's a tendency to follow the path of least effort, which might make us appear busy but doesn't always lead to productivity or meaningful results.

#### The Time Mastery: The Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management ally for knowledge workers, transforming productivity with 25-minute focused bursts followed by short breaks.

#### The Art of Subtlety: Calm Technology
Calm Technology is the quiet revolution in the digital world, advocating for a minimalist and intuitive interaction with our tools. It's about technology that serves us without constant demands for attention.
