## Working AmigoðŸ’»
The Working Amigo is a Pomodoro Technique-inspired tool that utilizes subtle lighting cues to enhance focus and productivity, while also serving as a non-verbal communication device to indicate work and rest periods to users and their surroundings.

## Background
#### The Great Illusion: Busyness as Productivity
For knowledge workers in today's hectic work setting, the challenge of deeply focusing on tasks, a concept Dr. Cal Newport discusses in his book "Deep Work," is all too common. This difficulty arises because it's often unclear how to measure the value of each person's contributions to their job. As a result, there's a tendency to follow the path of least effort, which might make us appear busy but doesn't always lead to productivity or meaningful results.

#### The Time Mastery: The Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management ally for knowledge workers, transforming productivity with 25-minute focused bursts followed by short breaks.

#### The Art of Subtlety: Calm Technology
Calm Technology is the quiet revolution in the digital world, advocating for a minimalist and intuitive interaction with our tools. It's about technology that serves us without constant demands for attention.

## Building Process

</p>


### 1. Set Up Wifi and MQTT connection with Arduino MKR 1010 WiFi

```C++
void startWifi() {
  if (WiFi.status() == WL_NO_MODULE) {
    Serial.println("WiFi module not found, cannot proceed.");
    while (true);
  }

  if (WiFi.firmwareVersion() < WIFI_FIRMWARE_LATEST_VERSION) {
    Serial.println("Firmware upgrade required.");
  }

  int n = WiFi.scanNetworks();
  if (n == 0) {
    Serial.println("No networks found.");
    return;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (WiFi.SSID(i).equals(ssid)) {
      WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
      while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) delay(600);
      Serial.println("Connected to WiFi: " + String(ssid));
      return;
    }
  }
  Serial.println("Failed to connect to any known network.");
}
```

```C++
void reconnectMQTT() {
  if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) startWifi();

  while (!client.connected()) {
    String clientId = "LuminaSelector" + String(random(0xffff), HEX);
    if (client.connect(clientId.c_str(), mqtt_username, mqtt_password)) {
      Serial.println("MQTT connected");
    } else {
      Serial.println("MQTT connection failed, retrying in 5 seconds...");
      delay(5000);
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Design the system
  We illuminate the Chrono Lumina by publish RGB info to the MQTT topics.

  #### 2.1. Dividing area: Chrono Lumina illuminate constantly
  ```cpp
  void controlDividingLine(int lights[], int numLights) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numLights; i++) {
      for (int pixel_id = 0; pixel_id < 12; pixel_id++) {
        sprintf(mqtt_topic_demo, "student/CASA0014/light/%d/pixel/", lights[i]);
        char mqtt_message[100];
        sprintf(mqtt_message, "{\"pixelid\": %d, \"R\": 255, \"G\": 0, \"B\": 0, \"W\": 0}", pixel_id);
        client.publish(mqtt_topic_demo, mqtt_message);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  #### 2.2. Stduy/Resting areas: Chrono Lumina illuminate with timer
  ```cpp
void controlStudyAreaWithTimer(int lights[], int numLights, bool dynamicEffect, int totalTime) {
    static float angle = 0.0;
    static unsigned long globalStartTime = millis();
    static int currentLightIndex = 0;

    int timeBlock = totalTime / numLights;
    unsigned long elapsedTime = millis() - globalStartTime;

    // Turn off lights if time is up
    if (elapsedTime > (unsigned long)(totalTime * 1000)) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numLights; i++) {
            for (int pixel_id = 0; pixel_id < 12; pixel_id++) {
                sprintf(mqtt_topic_demo, "student/CASA0014/light/%d/pixel/", lights[i]);
                char mqtt_message[100];
                sprintf(mqtt_message, "{\"pixelid\": %d, \"R\": 0, \"G\": 0, \"B\": 0, \"W\": 0}", pixel_id);
                client.publish(mqtt_topic_demo, mqtt_message);
            }
        }
        return;
    }

    // Determine current active light
    currentLightIndex = elapsedTime / (timeBlock * 1000);

    for (int i = 0; i < numLights; i++) {
        for (int pixel_id = 0; pixel_id < 12; pixel_id++) {
            sprintf(mqtt_topic_demo, "student/CASA0014/light/%d/pixel/", lights[i]);

            int R = 0, G = 0, B = 0, W = 0;
            if (i == currentLightIndex) {
                if (dynamicEffect) {
                    angle += 0.1;
                    if (angle > 2 * PI) angle -= 2 * PI;
                    float brightness = minBrightness + (maxBrightness - minBrightness) * (0.5 * (1 + sin(angle)));
                    R = (int)(brightness);
                    G = (int)(brightness * 0.5);
                    B = (int)(brightness * 0.2);
                } else {
                    R = 255;
                    G = 0;
                    B = 0;
                }
            }

            char mqtt_message[100];
            sprintf(mqtt_message, "{\"pixelid\": %d, \"R\": %d, \"G\": %d, \"B\": %d, \"W\": %d}", pixel_id, R, G, B, W);
            client.publish(mqtt_topic_demo, mqtt_message);
        }
    }
}

  ```
  ```controlStudyAreaWithTimer```  is a function designed to manage LED lights in a study or resting area via MQTT communication. Each light represents a time block determined by the total duration divided by the number of lights. During the current active time block, the corresponding light dynamically illuminates if dynamic effects are enabled; otherwise, it remains static. When the total time elapses, all lights turn off. The function ensures seamless control of both dynamic and static lighting effects based on a timer.
